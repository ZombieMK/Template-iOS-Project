# Template-iOS-Project
This is a template (starter) iOS project written in Objective-C. 
It can help you start a new project faster or if you are a begginer you can learn some good practices in iOS development.
The project contains template classes for Constants, Models, Network Client and Network Service
and an example for an UIView and an UIViewController. Also, it has a good and clean folder/files structure.

This project uses the following [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/):

- [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
- [Masonry](https://github.com/SnapKit/Masonry)
- [KVNProgress](https://github.com/AssistoLab/KVNProgress)
- [IQKeyboardManager](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager)

## How to get started
Download the project. Before running the xCode project, you need to install cocoapods. To do this follow these steps:

- Open terminal
- cd /the/path/to/your/project
- pod install

After the installation is complete, open the project directory in finder and you will see a new file with extension "xcworkspace" generated from cocoapods.

Open that file and start working!
